Angular Folder Structure - Highly Scalable
========================================

This project is inspired by various articles and GitHub repositories on Angular best practices. The code and structure are informed by best practices from the community, experiences from production Angular projects, and contributions from various developers. The primary goal of this project is to create a flexible skeleton structure suitable for projects of any scale.



Tree Structure
--------------

The following tree represents the recommended directory structure for a scalable Angular application. This structure aims to enhance organization, modularity, and maintainability.

```

      │   ├── core
      │   │   ├── services
      │   │   ├── interceptors
      │   │   └── guards

      │       ├── directives
      │       └── pipes

          └── global.scss

```

Directory Breakdown
media: Contains static assets such as images, icons, and other media files.

src/app: The main application source folder.

core: Contains singleton services, application-wide guards, and interceptors. These are critical services and utilities that are used throughout the application.
services: Core services such as authentication and logging.
interceptors: HTTP interceptors for modifying requests and responses.
guards: Route guards to protect routes from unauthorized access.
data: Contains data models and repositories. This is where you define your application's data structures and data access logic.
models: Data models representing the application's entities.
repositories: Services or classes that handle data persistence and retrieval.
layout: Contains layout-related components and containers. This is where you define the overall structure of your application's UI.
components: Reusable layout components such as headers, footers, and sidebars.
containers: Container components that group related layout components and manage their interactions.
modules: Feature modules organized by functionality. Each module is self-contained and manages its own components, services, and routing.
feature1: Example feature module.
components: Components specific to feature1.
services: Services related to feature1.
feature1.module.ts: Angular module definition for feature1.
feature2: Another feature module following the same structure.
shared: Contains shared components, directives, and pipes that are used across multiple modules.
components: Reusable components used throughout the application.
directives: Custom directives for modifying the behavior of DOM elements.
pipes: Custom pipes for transforming data in templates.
styles: Contains global styles and themes.

themes: Styles for different application themes.
variables: SCSS variables and mixins.
global.scss: Global styles applied across the application.
Additional Considerations
Modularity: Organize your features and functionality into modules to promote reusability and separation of concerns.

Scalability: This structure supports scalable project growth by keeping related files together and minimizing interdependencies.

Testing: Consider adding folders for unit tests and e2e tests (e2e/ or tests/) for maintaining test suites alongside your application code.

Documentation: Maintain clear documentation and comments within your codebase to help current and future developers understand the structure and purpose of different parts of the application.

Feel free to adjust this structure based on your project’s specific needs and complexity. This setup is designed to provide a robust foundation for developing large-scale Angular applications while maintaining flexibility and clarity.
